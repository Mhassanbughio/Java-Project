# Java-Project
This is my spare time Java Project. I'm trying to create a simple but useful program such as a simple game like snake and ladders and etc and It's a **CLI Program**.
#### Table of Content :
Title | Description

[Simple Snake and Ladders](https://github.com/zhafrant/Java-Project/tree/master/Simple%20snake%20and%20ladder) | A simple Snake and Ladders (maybe it's more likely a dice game)
[Rock Scissor Paper Game](https://github.com/zhafrant/Java-Project/tree/master/Rock%20Scissor%20Paper%20Game) | Just like a usual rock scissor and paper game
